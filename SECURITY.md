## Ecosystem & Compatibility

| Component            | Version(s) / Tooling               | Notes                                                                                               |

| OS baseline          | WSL (Ubuntu 25.10)                 | Shared environment across tracks.                                                                   |
| Ruby CLI utilities   | Ruby 4.0.2 (`.ruby-version`)       | Uses standard library (`CSV`, `FileUtils`). Declare extra gems per script if needed.                |
| Python CLI utilities | CPython 3.14.5 (`.python-version`) | Uses Python stdlib (`csv`, `argparse`). Introduce `requirements.txt` if third-party libs are added. |

## Backward Compatibility

- Command-line prompts and delimiter-conversion logic remain stable within Ruby 4.0.x / Python 3.14.x. Any breaking change will be announced in the README.
- Earlier interpreter majors are not tested and will not receive backports.
